# productManagement

This is a simple angularJS based product management web based GUI that allows one to view,update and add new product information.

The backend has been proxied using javascript. Its flexible in the sense that all that needs to be done to connect it to a real web server is remove the proxy data service and subsitute a call to the real web server to fetch data.
